I'm Steven, a PhD Candidate in the [Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences](https://aosc.umd.edu/) at the [University of Maryland](https://umd.edu/). I sit in the [Cryospheric Sciences Laboratory](https://earth.gsfc.nasa.gov/cryo) at [NASA Goddard Space Flight Center](https://www.nasa.gov/goddard), where I study sea ice using airborne and satellite instruments.
